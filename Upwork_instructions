Looking for someone to create a simple script (PHP, PowerShell, or any language) to help match files to QuickBooks transactions. The script will:
1. Scan a folder for PDF files.
2. Use the file name (formatted as YYYY-MM-DD_Amount_Supplier.pdf) to extract the date and amount—no need to check file content.
3. Search QuickBooks for a matching transaction (date ±3 days, exact amount).
4. If a match is found, check existing QuickBooks attachments. If the file is new, attach it to the transaction.


This is a straightforward starter project, and we’ll take care of the rest. No advanced experience required—just get the basics working!
